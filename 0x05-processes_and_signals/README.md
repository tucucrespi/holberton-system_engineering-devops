Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General

What is a PID
What is a process
How to find a processâ€™ PID
How to kill a process
What is a signal
What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored
Requirements

General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your Bash script files must be executable
Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.3-1~ubuntu14.04.1 via apt-get) without any error
The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

# Tasks

# 0. What is my PID mandatory

Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-what-is-my-pid
4120
sylvain@ubuntu$
Repo:

GitHub repository: holberton-system_engineering-devops
Directory: 0x05-processes_and_signals
File: 0-what-is-my-pid

# 1. List your processes mandatory

Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

Requirements:

Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
Display in a user-oriented format
Show process hierarchy


# 2. Show your Bash PID mandatory

Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:

You cannot use pgrep
The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here)

# 3. Show your Bash PID made easy mandatory

Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

Requirements:

You cannot use ps

# 4. To infinity and beyond mandatory

Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

Requirements:

In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2

# 5. Don't stop my now! mandatory

We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You must use kill
Terminal #0

Terminated
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
Terminal #1

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-dont_stop_me_now 
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my 4-to_infinity_and_beyond Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run 5-dont_stop_me_now. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.

# 6. Stop me if you can mandatory

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You cannot use kill or killall
Terminal #0

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond

Terminated
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
Terminal #1

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./6-stop_me_if_you_can
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my 4-to_infinity_and_beyond Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run 6-stop_me_if_you_can. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.

#7. Highlander mandatory

Write a Bash script that displays:

To infinity and beyond indefinitely
With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

Terminal #0

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
I am invincible!!!
To infinity and beyond

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-stop_me_if_you_can 
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-stop_me_if_you_can
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-stop_me_if_you_can
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 67-stop_me_if_you_can in terminal #1, for every iteration we can see I am invincible!!! appearing in terminal #0.

# 8. Beheaded process mandatory

Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

Terminal #0

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander 
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
Killed
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
Terminal #1

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./8-beheaded_process
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 8-beheaded_process in terminal #1 and we can see that the 7-highlander has been killed.
